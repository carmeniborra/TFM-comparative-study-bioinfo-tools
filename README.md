# TFM-comparative-study-bioinfo-tools
This project aims to perform a comparative study of bioinformatics tools and pipelines, for the analysis of metagenomic sequencing data. By benchmarking different analysis approaches using publicly available datasets and reference materials, this work seeks to evaluate their performance, strengths, and limitations.
